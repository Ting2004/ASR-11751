# General Information

___



- lecture indexing is off by one from the index of slides
  - since the first lecture is a very broad intro and therefore no notes are made 
  - note 04 corresponds to the lecture 05 slide
- **[IMPORTANT]** tags are used when Shinji explicitly mentions "it is a good question on midterm/exam"
